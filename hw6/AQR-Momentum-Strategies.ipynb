But you are expected to consider these issues and be ready to discuss them.\n\n### 1.1 \nWhat is novel about the AQR Momentum product under construction compared to the various momentum investment products already offered?\n\n### 1.2 \nName three reasons the momentum investment product will not exactly track the momentum index, (ie. why the strategy will have tracking error.)\n\n### 1.3 \nWhen constructing the momentum portfolio, AQR ranks stocks on their returns from month $t-12$ through $t-2$. Why don't they include the $t-1$ return in this ranking?"
