    "## Data\n",
    "You will need the file in the github repo, `data/multi_asset_etf_data.xlsx`.\n",
    "- The time-series data gives monthly returns for the 11 asset classes and a short-term Treasury-bill fund return, (\"SHV\",) which we consider as the risk-free rate.\n",
    "- The data is provided in total returns, (in which case you should ignore the SHV column,) as well as excess returns, (where SHV has been subtracted from the other columns.)\n",
    "- These are nominal returns-they are not adjusted for inflation, and in our calculations we are not making any adjustment for inflation.\n",
    "- The exhibit data that comes via Harvard with the case is unnecessary for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "We are going to analyze the problem in terms of **excess** returns.\n",
    "- Thus, you will focus on the `Excess Returns` section of the lecture notes, especially the formulas on slide 50.\n",
    "- Be sure to use the`excess returns` tab of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format\n",
    "In the questions below, **annualize the statistics** you report.\n",
    "- Annualize the mean of monthly returns with a scaling of 12.\n",
    "- Annualize the volatility of monthly returns with a scaling of $\\sqrt{12}$\n",
    "- The Sharpe Ratio is the mean return divided by the volatility of returns. Accordingly, we can annualize the Sharpe Ratio with a scaling of $\\sqrt{12}$\n",
    "- Note that we are not scaling the raw timeseries data, just the statistics computed from it (mean, vol, Sharpe).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data File\n",
    "* The case does not give time-series data, so this data has been compiled outside of the case, and it intends to represent the main asset classes under consideration via various ETFs. For details on the specific securities/indexes, check the “Info” tab of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk-free rate\n",
    "* In the lecture-note we considered a constant risk-free rate. It is okay that our risk-free rate changes over time, but the assumption is that investors know it’s value one-period ahead of time. Thus, at any given point in time, it is a risk-free rate for the next period. (This is often discussed as the \"bank account\" or \"money market account\" in other settings."
